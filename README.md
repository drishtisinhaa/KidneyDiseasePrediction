# Healthcare Domain Project - Kidney Disease Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze and predict kidney disease using machine learning techniques. The dataset undergoes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering before training predictive models.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- Name: `kidney_disease.csv`   
- Description: Contains patient data with various health indicators to determine kidney disease presence.  

## 🚀 Key Steps  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
   - Visualization of Key Features  
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Scaling & Normalization (MinMaxScaler)  
   - Handling Missing Values  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Splitting data into Train & Test  
   - Training Machine Learning models  
   - Evaluating Performance Metrics  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Train-Test Split, MinMaxScaler, Model Training)

  ## Results and Insights -
  This project predict whether the pateint has a chronic kidney disease or not based on the data entered by the user , on an html page . I've developed it using streamlit and pickle.
